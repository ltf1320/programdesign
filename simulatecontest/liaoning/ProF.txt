Description
   I think you know The Euler Phi Function .Given a number M, The Euler Phi Function can calculate that how many numbers which are smaller than M ,are prime to the M. But this question may be much easier. Now , we have a little more difficult problem .Give you two numbers N and M(1< N,M <10^13). You should give me how many numbers which are smaller than M, prime to both N and M.
Input
 There are several test cases.
 Each line contains two numbers, N and M.
 Input terminated by EOF.
Output
 A single integer in one line for each case.
Sample Input
10 15
