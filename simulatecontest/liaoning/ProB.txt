Description
There is a directed graph with N vertex (1<=N<=10000) and M edges (1<=M<=50000). Vertex is named from 1 to N. If a vertex can be reached by every vertex, we can call it super vertex. Now we want to know the number of super vertex in the graph.

Input
There are several cases. In each case:  

Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and M.

Line 2бн1+M: Two space-separated numbers A and B, meaning that there is a edge from A to B.

Output
In each case:

Line 1: A single integer that is the number of super vertex.
