Description
YY is a tall and handsome boy whose family has much money. One day, YY finds that there are several black points on his white wall. He can¡¯t stand the ugly situation which is caused by these black points. He decides to let these black points disappear.  He cut a convex shape from a piece of white paper and adhere it onto the wall so that any other people can¡¯t see the black points. What a wonderful job, he thinks.
   What¡¯s more, YY wants to save much pieces of paper as possible. Now, you are asked to help him to count the least area of the convex shape. 
Input
   The input file consists of several test cases.
   The first line of the input file contains an integer, T(1<=T<=10) which is the number of the test cases. Each test case contains an integer N(1<=N<=1000) which is the number of the points. Then N lines following have two integers X and Y (0<=X,Y<=1000 ) per line which is the positions of the black points. 
Output
   The output file consists of N lines. Each line start with the number of the test case like this ¡°Case #x: ¡±. And then the number of minimum area of the convex shape which is retained one decimal place.
